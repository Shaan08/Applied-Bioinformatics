1. How many databases are available for cat, felis catus?

   Command:
   SHOW databases LIKE 'felis%';
   
   Result:
   5 databases (only core databases)

2. Use the show and describe commands to figure what tables are related to describing genes, transcripts, and exons.
   What information are these tables storing and how do the tables relate to each other?

   Commands:
   SELECT DATABASE();  # should return null if none is selected
   USE homo_sapiens_core_55_37;  # Returns database changed
   SELECT DATABASE();  # Returns that the database is selected
   SHOW TABLES;  # Returns all tables that exist in database, 83 rows

   There are tables; dna, exon, exon transcript, transcript and gene.
   exon seems to have the columns;
   exon_id, seq_region_id, seq_region_start, seq_region_end, seq_region_strand,
   phase and end_phase.

   All of the columns type are short ints, meaning that no sequence data is found.
   As the picture in the folder, the sequence is located in one table while the others
   tables contains descripshow dna;tion used for annotation and describing each gene.

3. How many genes are registered for human? Make a breakdown based on the column "biotype"
   by using the GROUP BY directive.

   In the table "gene", a column called biotype is found. I will use that to count the
   amount of genes. NOTE: Using homo_sapiens_core_55_37 database

   Command:
   SELECT biotype, COUNT(1) FROM gene GROUP BY biotype;
   Result:

+------------------------+----------+
| biotype                | COUNT(1) |
+------------------------+----------+
| IG_C_gene              |       21 |
| IG_D_gene              |       30 |
| IG_J_gene              |       93 |
| IG_V_gene              |      217 |
| miRNA                  |     1702 |
| misc_RNA               |     1565 |
| Mt_rRNA                |        2 |
| Mt_tRNA                |       22 |
| polymorphic_pseudogene |       12 |
| processed_transcript   |     6009 |
| protein_coding         |    23279 |
| pseudogene             |     8213 |
| rRNA                   |      462 |
| snoRNA                 |     1217 |
| snRNA                  |     1441 |
+------------------------+----------+
15 rows in set (0.12 s

   Command: SELECT COUNT(1) FROM gene;
   Result:
   44285 hits

4. How many processed pseudogenes have a non-empty description string? 

   Gene table has many columns. We are interested in biotype and description.
   Check every row where biotype has pseudogene and then check if description column is empty.

   Command:
   SELECT COUNT(1) FROM gene WHERE gene.biotype LIKE '%pseudogene' AND gene.description IS NOT NULL;
   Result:
   201 hits

   NOTE: This number seems a bit low! If you have gene.biotype, you only get "pseudogene" and nothing else.
   However, if you remove NOT from IS NOT NULL, you get thousands of hits. Maybe the particular database has few descriptions?
   This seems to be the case, since using the command below gives 15925 hits.
   SELECT COUNT(1) FROM gene WHERE gene.description IS NULL;
   And using this command gets us 18636 hits.
   SELECT COUNT(1) FROM gene WHERE gene.description IS NOT NULL;

   Maybe pseudogenes just happens to not have descriptions?


5. How many transcripts are associated with the two breast-cancer associated genes BRCA1 (ENSG00000012048) and BRCA2 (ENSG00000139618)?
   Your solution is supposed to be written as one SQL query. 

   Easy peasy! Just check where the associated genes are in which table/column.
   Found ids in gene_archive in column gene_stable_id. Each id is associated with transcript --> number of entries with name = transcripts
   https://www.ensembl.org/Help/View?id=143
   https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/core/core_schema.html#gene
   
   TIP: use SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> LIMIT <number of prints>

   SELECT COUNT(1) FROM gene_archive WHERE gene_stable_id LIKE 'ENSG00000012048' OR gene_stable_id LIKE 'ENSG00000139618';

   Result:
   62 hits 44(55_37 db)

   NOTE: if only ...12048 is choosen, 59 hits and ....139618 has 3 hits.
   This will of course be different if you are looking at another homo_sapiens_core database!
