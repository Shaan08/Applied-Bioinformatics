## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Shaan08/BioInformatics/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
Reading from the commandline

As an example of how to read from the commandline, consider creating a file called "reveal" with this contents

   #! /usr/bin/env python
   import sys
   print sys.argv
and then execute the command

   chmod +x reveal
to make it executable. Then, try you new program by running (for example)

   reveal a b c

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text 

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Shaan08/BioInformatics/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
